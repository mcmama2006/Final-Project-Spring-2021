        <p>I am neither a farmer or a world traveler compared to some. But in dabbling I have found so much depth,
            work, life and joy.</p>
        <p>
            When we got married, my husband and I had many grand dreams. Even two that seemed to conflict: farm life and
            travel.</p>
        <p>Do those usually go together...?</p>
        <p>...Who cares.</p>
        <p>We know what we like. :)</p>
        <p>Even though we had our desires in mind, in our first few years they seemed out of grasp. Everything, it turns
            out, takes money.
            And sweat, and planning, and banging your head against the wall.
        </p>
        <p>And money.</p>
        <p>However, we have decided to stop worrying, take chances, and chase after what we had hoped for in the
            beginning.</p>
        <p>Totally worth it!!</p>
        <p>Our three kids are a little shy on this site - they enjoy their privacy. But it's because of them that we try
            hard to never give up and to keep after the life we truly want.
        </p>
        <p>When we were finally able to take them to Thailand, and get them the pet ducks they wanted, all our scraping
            by and getting cut by chicken wire came together to equal: yes. This is why we do what we do.</p>
        <p>In my galleries you will see that we started small. A few animals. Not in the "dream home." Little trips,
            sometimes with and sometimes
            without the littles, at first</p>
        <p>And our journey is far from over. Living in a fixer-upper has its challenges. Animal enclosures are not
            complete. Garden boxes and a greenhouse are quite a ways off still. But we moved all the way from California
            to Pennsylvania to give all of us - animal and human
            alike - the chance for all the good things of life we believe we will yet achieve.
        </p>
        <p>While we continue to grow, build, explore and save up for all we continue to aim for in the future, I hope
            that you can enjoy this site!</p>
        <p>It's full of my first ever attempts at building a website. And full of my heart.</p>
