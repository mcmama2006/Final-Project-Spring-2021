            Aside from the love I have of sharing my photos (and sharing my newfound ability to build a webpage that
            can showcase them!), I also love, and have a deep passion for our beautiful planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Caring for animals and plants brings big questions.
        </p>
        <p>Do I use pesticides? What should my animals eat? Where do I buy all their food? How is the way I am living
            impacting the environment around me?</p>
        <p>
            Travel also has consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time we fly we use a fuel-powered plane. We can accidently bring foreign
            creatures - from viruses to bugs to plants - to other ecosystems. Where we spend our money can alter what
            happens down the road to the places we visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years we have researched and studied to understand what our actions could cause or create, and what
            our role in all of that is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes those first steps to caring can be really hard. Once you start to learn about the "wrongs" in the
            world, it feels you can do no right.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, if you just take a step - make one change, take on one new responsibility, or teach someone else
            something they didn't know - you realize that maybe caring is also empowering.
        </p>
        <p>One person may not make a world of difference, but you can make wonderful differences in your own world.</p>
        <p> For instance: We have chosen to not use pesticides or weed killers. We do not always feed our animals
            organic food, but we
            do try to when the price is not too different. We try to support local feedstores rather than big chains.
            For our own produce we want to start a garden! And in the
            meantime, we buy organic when we can there as well. We eat little meat, and try to be careful about
            preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings. These are a few choices we have made</p>
        <p>As a family we are working toward a bigger feat to be plastic free. Of course there are challenges to this.
            But we have
            made small improvements, like no sandwich bags, plastic wrap, and we avoid products sold in plastic whenever
            there is another option. Like our shampoo bars (versus bottles)! They are amazing!</p>
        <p>
            Traveling is a little trickier. But we try to space out our trips, and love and enjoy what is around us in
            between. In order to cut back at home we try to meal plan and make less trips into town to shop. That way,
            when we do take a vacation, we can feel that we offset our carbon footprint a little. We look into the
            places we are going and always try to support local hotels, vendors, restuarant owners and such. We also
            avoid places that we feel may be over-traveled and could lose their ecosystems to too much change. Or we
            avoid places where the tourism industry is keeping its people in poverty.
        </p>
        <p>Nobody should drive themselves crazy, or stress out to where they no longer enjoy life because they are too
            worried about their negative impact on the world. But if each of us makes some changes, then makes a few
            more, think of the huge change we would all contribute to!</p>
        <p>Our farm is about our family, animals and land. Seeing the world is about becoming a little more acquainted
            with the people, cultures and needs in the countries and areas we visit.</p>
        <p>How could we possibly separate all that we have, and have seen, with the big picture around us?
        </p>
        <p>Alone, our little McIntosh family is not going to save the planet. But we are going to keep our hearts open
            to anything that inspires us to do a little more. And if nothing else, we can know that we put our actions
            where our hearts are.</p>
